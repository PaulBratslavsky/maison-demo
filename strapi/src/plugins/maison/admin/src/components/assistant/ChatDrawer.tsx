/**
 * The drawer: fixed to the right edge of the window, the full height, white, with a border on its left and the popup shadow. Its width is the width
 * of the chat, and of the list of saved chats while that is open (`drawerWidthOf`), and is never more than 90vw. It changes over 0.2 seconds, in
 * step with the list, which changes its own width in the same time, so the chat keeps its width as the list opens. It slides in from the right when
 * it opens. The page beside it stays usable: there is no dark layer behind it. Staff who prefer less motion get no slide and no change of width over time.
 *
 * It is not taken out of the page when it is closed. It is hidden: out of sight (`visibility`), out of reach of the pointer, and out of the keyboard
 * and the accessibility tree (`inert`, `aria-hidden`). Drawing it again would draw the chat's screen again, and what staff see when they open the
 * drawer must be what they left: the same messages, the same text box with what they typed in it, and where they had scrolled to. The box is a
 * content box, so the 1px border is outside its width and the chat column is exactly as wide as the chat. It is written out because the design
 * system's global style makes every box a border box, and in a border box the border would take one pixel from the chat.

/**
 * The assistant's drawer: what the Ask tab was, in a panel that opens from a button on every admin page. The chat itself, and the text staff have
 * typed and not sent, are in the provider above, and the drawer stays in the page while it is closed, so both are as staff left them when they close
 * the drawer and open it again, and while they move between pages. Opening the drawer never starts a chat: only the New chat buttons do. Without a
 * set-up assistant the drawer shows why, and no text box.
 *
 * - Opening moves the focus to the text box. The text box is not there while the assistant is checked, or when it is not set up, so then the
 *   focus goes to the drawer, which Escape works from, and moves to the text box when it comes.
 * - Escape closes the drawer, when the focus is in it. It does not close it for an Escape that something else has used (a tooltip closing, or the
 *   list of tools, which says so by cancelling the event or by stopping it), and not for the Escape that cancels the conversion of Japanese.
 * - There is no focus trap: the page stays usable.
 * - Expand makes the chat wider and does nothing else. History alone shows and hides the saved chats, as a column beside the chat, and the drawer
 *   is wider by that column while it is open.
