 * Which menu icon looks after the assistant. Strapi draws Maison's menu icon more than once at the same time: in the left menu, and again in
 * the mobile menu while that is open (`MainNavIcons` and `MainNavBurgerMenuLinks` in @strapi/admin 5.55.1). The assistant is one chat, so only
 * one of those icons may look after it.
 *
 * Each icon claims when it mounts and releases when it unmounts. The owner is the oldest icon that has claimed and not released. When the owner
 * releases, the oldest icon that is left takes over. React's `useSyncExternalStore` reads `owner` and listens through `subscribe`.
