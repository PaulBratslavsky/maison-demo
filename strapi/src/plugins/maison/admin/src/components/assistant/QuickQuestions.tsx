/**
 * The five quick questions: a row of small buttons between the messages and the text box. They are there for the whole chat, from the empty chat on,
 * so a demo can use them at any point (Paul, 7 October: "so they don't disappear after the first request"). They replace the three starters, which
 * were in the empty chat only.
 *
 * - They are outside the message list, so they never scroll with it. They take the room of the rows they need and no more, and never shrink
 *   (`flex: 0 0 auto`): the list gives up height, not the buttons.
 * - They wrap onto a second line, and a third, when the drawer is narrow. The row never scrolls sideways.
 * - Each is the design system's small button in its quiet look (tertiary: a white fill and a grey border), so Send stays the one filled button
 *   and the list keeps its room. The side padding is the text box's own, 16px.
 * - This only draws them. What a press does is the drawer's: it sends the question as a starter, which leaves the text staff have typed in the
 *   box, and puts the focus in the box.
