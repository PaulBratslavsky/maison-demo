/**
 * The assistant's host: the one place on the screen where the assistant is kept, in a React root of its own, in an element added to the body.
 *
 * Why it is not in the menu icon. Strapi has no place for something that is on every admin page, but it draws every menu link's icon on every
 * signed-in page (`LeftMenu` and `MainNavLinks` in @strapi/admin 5.55.1), so Maison's menu icon is how the assistant gets onto every page. But
 * Strapi draws the icon again on every change of address: `LeftMenu` reads the location, and `MainNavIcons` makes a new component type for each
 * link on every render, so React removes the old icon and draws a new one. Anything the icon held, the chat among it, would be lost at
 * each click on a menu link, and at each change of tab on the Maison page. And an answer on its way would be stopped.
 *
 * So the icon holds nothing. It tells the host what Strapi's providers say and the host cannot read (the theme, the language and whether the
 * admin may use the assistant), and it keeps the host in place for as long as an icon is on the screen. The host's own React root has no
 * Strapi provider, which the chat does not need: it reads the theme and the language from what the icon tells it, and it calls the server with
 * `useFetchClient`, which does not read a provider. When no icon has been drawn for a short time, the admin has left the signed-in pages
 * (they signed out), and the host removes the assistant and its chat.
 *
 * A failure inside the host, while drawing or while loading the chunk, would unmount the whole root and take the launcher with it. The root is
 * inside an error boundary (AssistantBoundary.tsx) that keeps the launcher and shows a short fixed text instead.
 *
 * The chat is loaded when it is needed. Its code (the Markdown, TanStack AI and the rest) is a chunk of its own, loaded the first time an admin
 * who may use the assistant is on a page, and not in the admin's first bundle for everyone.
