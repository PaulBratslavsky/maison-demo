/**
 * The assistant's answer, drawn from Markdown: paragraphs, lists, tables, code, quotes and links. Copied from strapi-plugin-tanstack-ai
 * 1.6.0 (`MarkdownBody` in `MessageList.tsx`), with these changes.
 * - The four tints that were literal black overlays are theme colours, so inline code, code blocks and table headers show in the dark theme.
 * - Lists have their markers and headings their weight. The design system's global style takes both away (`list-style: none`, `font: unset`).
 * - Tables. The reference keeps every cell on one line, which is right for a chat the width of a page and wrong for a drawer. Here a header cell stays
 *   on one line, and a body cell wraps its text between words, in a column between 7rem and 22rem wide: a short value (a date, a reference, a masked
 *   customer) keeps its line, and a long text wraps inside its column. A word is broken only when it is longer than the column can be (`overflow-wrap:
 *   break-word`). Never `anywhere` or `break-all`: those shrink every column to a letter or two. The bubble's own `word-break: break-word` is inherited by
 *   the cells, so a body cell sets `word-break: normal` back.
 *   The table is as wide as its columns want to be (`width: max-content`) and is never made to fit the bubble. A browser that makes a table fit
 *   squeezes the columns down to the shortest piece each can break at: it broke `2026-10-05` after its second hyphen and `line:Udec…02` before its last
 *   two characters, in a real browser at 600px. So a table that is wider than the bubble scrolls sideways instead, in a box of its own (`TableScroll`),
 *   and nothing else moves: not the message list, not the drawer, and not the browser's swipe back (`overscroll-behavior-x`). The 7rem and 22rem of the
 *   cells are in the admin's rem, which is 10px because the design system sets the root font size to 62.5%, so a column is 70px to 220px wide.
 * - Images are not drawn, and only an `http:` or `https:` link is a link (see `MarkdownLink`). The model reads customer text, and an image
 *   address or a link could carry other customers' words out of the page.
 * Raw HTML in an answer is shown as text: react-markdown does not render it.
