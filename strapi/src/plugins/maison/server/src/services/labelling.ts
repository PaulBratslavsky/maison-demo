 * Why a sweep stops on a failed call, when the failure says nothing against the inquiry: every row would meet it until it

 *   know, which is what a wrong AI_MODEL gives, or a wrong address).
 * - `no-answer`: the provider didn't answer. The SDK retries a call that never connected, or that got a 408, 409, 429 or a
 *   5xx, twice, and gives up with a `RetryError`. The 30-second timeout and an abort are errors named `TimeoutError` and
 *   `AbortError`. A connection that never came up and wasn't retried into a `RetryError` is an `APICallError` with no status,
 *   or the fetch failure itself, a `TypeError` saying "fetch failed".
 * Anything else counts against the inquiry, and this answers null: a wrong answer (`NoObjectGeneratedError`), a status that
 * comes with that inquiry's own text (a 400, a 413, a 422), an error nobody has a class for, Strapi failing to save. The
 * inquiry fails, and the sweep goes on with the next one.
