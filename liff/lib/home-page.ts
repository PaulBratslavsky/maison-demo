 * The Home page's text in both languages, for Home's server component. It hands both to the client screen, so the
 * language switch stays instant. Server-only: it reaches Strapi the way the app's server does, at strapiOrigin(), never
 * at NEXT_PUBLIC_STRAPI_URL, which in LINE mode is the app's own public address.
 *
 * The text is Strapi's Home page single type (api::home-page.home-page), as published, asked for on every request (no
 * cache), for both languages at once, each within `timeoutMs`. A language falls back to the built-in text (lib/copy.ts,
 * the same words as Strapi's starting text) when its request fails or times out, when Strapi answers anything but 200,
 * or when its eyebrow, headline or CTA label is missing or blank. The other language keeps Strapi's text. A blank intro
 * is no reason to fall back: it means there's none. `fetchImpl` and `timeoutMs` are for the tests.
