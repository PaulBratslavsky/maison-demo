 * - `recorded`: under the first call that handed the question to the advisors and went through, whatever the searches
 *   found: a hand_off_to_staff the model made, or a search_knowledge that found nothing and the app's server handed off
 *   itself (its result's `handOff`, which is why the note shows at once, with no call after the search for it to wait
 *   for). `recorded` is what Strapi recorded, so the note names the question's reference, and its button sends the
 *   question in the LINE chat.
 * - No note while a hand_off_to_staff is still running. It may yet go through, and the plain note would show under the
 *   search or the failure and then be replaced by the recorded one.
 * - `empty_search`: under the last search_knowledge, if it came back whole with no entries and nothing was recorded for
 *   it. The app's server hands such a question off itself, so this is when that failed (Strapi refused it, or the token
 *   can't hand questions off) or couldn't be made.
 * - `failed_hand_off`: under the last hand_off_to_staff, which failed: it broke on the way, Maison refused it, or its
 *   result has no reference to show.
 * The last two are the plain note, with `recorded` null: it says only where the team answers, never that the question is
 * with the advisors, and it leaves the customer the LINE chat, so they can always reach a person.
 *
 * The conditions below are the empty search's alone; a hand-off that went through or failed needs none. It shows only
 * when no search in the message found entries (the question may be answered) and none is still running (a note that
 * showed while a second search was under way would vanish when that one found the answer). The last search decides: an
 * earlier one that failed or was refused doesn't count, because rule 6 has the model fix its arguments and search again,
 * and the local model makes bad first calls. A last search that failed or was refused has no note of its own, and a
 * failed hand-off may.
